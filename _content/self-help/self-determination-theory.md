ðŸ’¡SDT stands for Self-Determination Theory

# Universal psychological needs
We have 3 universal psychological needs (given our physiological needs are met):

* Autonomy (feeling in control and having choice, making one's decisions in an informed way, taking responsibility, feeling free and willing...)
* Competence (having a level of challenge were one has opportunity to grow, not too difficult nor too easy => allows the state of flow, feeling able and confident in one's abilities, having achievable goals...)
* Relatedness (feeling connected socially, having a good social network and being supported by it, feeling people care about yourself...)

They are universally important for psychological wellbeing and autonomous motivation.

# Self-esteem

We only need self-esteem when we don't have enough of it, but in itself it doesn't provide happiness or wellbeing.

# Mindfulness

(Not directly related to meditation.) One needs mindfulness to achieve congruence (harmony between one's ideal self and one's actual experience). Living in "automatic pilot" mode doesn't allow one to find congruence. Mindfulness can be assessed with the MAAS (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale) questionnaire.

# Emotions

A positive emotion is a feedback that one's goal is close to or on the way to be reached. A negative emotion is a sign that something's preventing from reaching or heading towards that goal.

# Intrinsic motivation

Intrinsic motivation refers to the activities we would do if we weren't expecting any reward (recognition, salary, love...) and wouldn't be under any constraint (paying rent and groceries...). Those motivations are destroyed or damaged by controlling environments. One needs autonomy, competence, relatedness and mindfulness to recognize and practice activities that are motivated by intrinsic motivation.

Extrinsic motivations, like status and wealth, are highly dependent on external factors and don't allow people to be autonomous. For example, status or wealth are highly dependant on the market, it requires to make connections with specific people (even when we don't want to).
