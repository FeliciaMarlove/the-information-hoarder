# Low water gardening

## Efficient watering

* When it's cold at night, water early in the morning. When nights aren't too cold, water in the evening.
* It's better to pour a lot of water less often, than to pour a little water often. Superficial watering causes roots to spread horizontally, while deeper watering causes roots to get deeper and develop vertically. The deeper the roots, the easier to find water naturally occurring in the ground.

## Plants resilience vs drought

* If chosen well, taking into account the local climate and soil type, most plants will need watering only the first summer (in normal heat conditions), up to the two to three first summers for trees.
* In colder climates, it's better to plant in spring. In hotter climates, spring and autumn are valid periods to plant.
* The stronger the plant, the more resilient. Plants that have been in place for a few years and grow healthy are less at risk of heavily suffering from drought.
* A plant that has to survive in dry conditions will sacrifice its flowers to keep energy for the leaves and roots.
