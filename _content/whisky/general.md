# Whisky: general knowledge

Whiskey with an **e** = produced in the USA or Ireland.

Rejuvenated cask = Cask that was already used several times and lost its flavor. The flavorless layer is removed and it gets burnt again to be reused.

The age of a blend equals the age of the youngest whisky in it.
