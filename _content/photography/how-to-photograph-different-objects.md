# How to take pictures of different objects

## Flowers

### Outside 
Best on a cloudy day, avoid direct sunlight (if sunny, do it in the morning or evening). 
Right after rain.
If it's windy, set a higher speed and/or burst mode (continuous photography mode)

### Inside
Use a black or white background.

### Creative ideas
- Spray some water for a raindrops effect.
