# How to take pictures of different subjects

## Flowers

### Outside 
Best on a cloudy day, avoid direct sunlight (if sunny, do it in the morning or evening). 
Right after rain.
If it's windy, set a higher speed and/or burst mode (continuous photography mode)

### Inside
Use a black or white background.

### Creative ideas
- Spray some water for a raindrops effect.

## People

Focus on one eye.

If the person is visibly tensed, ask them to do something (anything) with their hands to change their mind.

## Products (for marketing, advertisement...)

Use mirrors to get a homogeneous light.

Use a lightbox for objects that fit.
