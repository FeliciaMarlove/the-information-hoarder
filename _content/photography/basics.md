# Photography basics

ðŸ’¡Also see Exposure triangle

## Aperture fx.x
A small number = a big aperture. The smaller the number, the more light comes in. If there's a lot of natural light, we don't need a big aperture (eg f/16 for pictures in bright sun). If there isn't much light, we need a big aperture (eg f/4 for pictures at dawn).
The smaller the number, the more blur behind (and before) the focused subject.

## Speed x/x
Fixed subject = low speed (eg 1/4).
Moving subject = high speed (eg 1/2000).
/!\ More speed = less light.
When taking manual photographs (not with a tripod), set a higher speed to reduce unwanted blur.

## ISO
Use the smallest setting possible to avoid noise.
Examples:
100 = full sun, no shades
200 = very sunny, partial shade; interior with sunlight exposure
400 = sunny but cloudy day
700 = interior, sunny day, or a bit cloudy but next to a window
800 = interior, sunny day but far from a window
850-1000 = interior, cloudy day, far from a window
1250 = interior, evening, artificial light
1600 = interior, dark room, little light (example: a theatre)
6400 = night

## Exposure compensation -3..2..1..0..1..2..+3
Override automatic exposure adjustments of the camera.
Negatives = darker image, positives = brighter image
